# Pathfinding-Visualization
This project is a desktop-based Pathfinding Visualizer developed using Java and the Swing framework. The application visually demonstrates how popular pathfinding algorithms—specifically Dijkstra's Algorithm and A* Search Algorithm—work in real time on a grid-based layout. It serves as an educational tool for students and developers to understand how these algorithms explore a graph and find the shortest path between a start and an end point.

The visualizer features a customizable grid where users can set a start node, end node, and place walls to simulate obstacles. Nodes can be selected and modified using mouse interactions, with support for dragging and resetting. Once the grid is prepared, users can choose their desired algorithm from a dropdown and control the animation speed using a slider. A single “Run” button executes the selected algorithm, and the pathfinding process is animated step-by-step, highlighting visited nodes and the final path.

An additional feature is the Maze Generator, which uses the Recursive Backtracking algorithm to automatically generate a random perfect maze. This enhances user experience by quickly creating challenging scenarios for the pathfinding algorithms to solve.

The UI is designed with modularity and clarity in mind. All controls are neatly arranged at the top, and the grid is centered in the application window for optimal viewing. The program structure separates logic and UI, making the application maintainable and extendable—for instance, additional algorithms like BFS, DFS, or Bidirectional Search can be added with ease.

This project not only strengthens understanding of pathfinding algorithms but also showcases object-oriented design and GUI development skills in Java. It's ideal for academic demonstrations, algorithm analysis, and hands-on learning through interactive visualization.
